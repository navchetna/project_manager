<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Component Usage

In this section, you will understand how to use each of the components in the `src/components` folder. This example shows how to add all components into the `App.jsx` file in the `src` folder.

If you wish to use it in different files, adjust the imports accordingly

### Navbar

Add this to the top of your file:

```js
import Navbar from "./components/Navbar";
```

Use the Navbar Component as below:

```js
return (
  <>
    <Navbar
      navigationItems={NavItemsConfig.navigationItems}
      menuItems={NavItemsConfig.menuItems}
      logoPath={NavItemsConfig.logoPath}
    />
  </>
);
```

#### Navbar Props

Props are short for properties and these are the parameters you pass into the child component (Navbar.jsx) in the parent component (App.jsx)

All these props can be configured in a seperate config file present in `/src/config/NavItemsCOnfig.jsx`

The props for these include:

- `navigationItems` - Define the Tabs present in the Navbar
- `menuItems` - Define the dropdown items that appear when the Menu Bar (by default Cog Icon) is clicked.
- `logoPath` - Define the Url or Path of the image to be used as logo

### Sidebar

Add this to the top of your file:

```js
import Sidebar from "./components/Sidebar";
```

Use the Sidebar Component as below:

```js
return (
  <>
    <Sidebar sidebarItems={SidebarItemsConfig.sidebarItems} />
  </>
);
```

#### Sidebar Props

Props are short for properties and these are the parameters you pass into the child component (Sidebar.jsx) in the parent component (App.jsx)

All these props can be configured in a seperate config file present in `/src/config/SidebarItemsConfig.jsx`

The props for these include:

- `sidebarItems` - Define the Elements present in the Sidebar along with links to their respective pages

### Forms

Add this to the top of your file:

```js
import FormLayout from "./components/Forms/FormLayout";
```

Use the Form Component as below:

```js
return (
  <>
    <FormLayout />
  </>
);
```

NOTE: `<FormLayout/>` component houses many such child components like Radio Buttons, Dropdowns, Input Boxes etc. To see examples of their usage, check out `/src/components/Forms/FormLayout.jsx`

### VideoPlayer

Add this to the top of your file:

```js
import VideoPlayer from "./components/VideoPlayer";
```

Use the VideoPlayer Component as below:

```js
return (
  <>
    <VideoPlayer videoURL={"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk5bqlb5F4M"} />
  </>
);
```

#### VideoPlayer Props

Props are short for properties and these are the parameters you pass into the child component (VideoPlayer.jsx) in the parent component (App.jsx)

For this component, since there is only one prop that contains the link to the video, it can be directly passed as shown in the example above

The prop is:

- `videoUrl` - Pass the URL of the video that you want to be displayed

### Tables

(Under developement)

Add this to the top of your file:

```js
import TableBasic from "./components/Tables/TableBasic";
```

Use the TableBasic Component as below:

```js
return (
  <>
    <TableBasic />
  </>
);
```

### Layouts

Layouts are example configurations made using a combination of all the components listed above. They are designed in such a way that you can just place then in your main file (by default App.jsx) and start using them.

To use an example layout, import that layout in your main file as such:

```js
import Layout1 from "./layouts/Layout1";
```

Then use it as below:

```js
return (
  <>
    <Layout1 />
  </>
);
```

All the props for the child components of the layout can be managed inside the layout component.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## FastAPI Server

For the `<TableBasic>` Component, we need to fetch the relevant data from the FastAPI endpoint.

By default, this endpoint is at `http://localhost:3000/write-data` but this url and endpoint name can be changed in the `.env` file and `server/main.py` file respectively.

The data is hard coded inside this endpoint, but can easily be loaded from a config file as well.
NOTE: If you are editing the data, make sure you do not alter its format as that is essential for the table to be able to read the data

### FastAPI server

1. Firstly open a new terminal window and navigate inside the server folder (assuming you are in the root directory of composable-ui)

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Then run the following command on the terminal

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   `main` corresponds to the name of the file `main.py`

   `app` corresponds to the name of the variable used to initialise FastAPI.

   `--reload` is used to watch for changes in the `main.py` file, upon which the server automatically restarts, thus incorporating the new changes

<!-- #### Sidebar Props

Props are short for properties and these are the parameters you pass into the child component (VideoPlayer.jsx) in the parent component (App.jsx)

For this component, since there is only one prop that contains the link to the video, it can be directly passed as shown in the example above

The prop is:

- `videoUrl` - Pass the URL of the video that you want to be displayed -->
